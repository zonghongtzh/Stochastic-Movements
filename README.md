# Intention
To use stochastic datasets from one area to mimic the stochastic behavior in another area

### Example:
A bee's flight path has a general directionality (Diagonally upwards). However, it's flight tends to randomly move from left to right and up to down.

A stock's price movement also has the element of general directionality (Diagonally upwards), but randomly moves upwards and downwards. 

By piecing together 3 different stock prices (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT), the combined coordinates of the prices seems to somewhat capture the subtle random movements in the upward flight of a bee.
