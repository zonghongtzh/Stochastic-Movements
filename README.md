# Intention
To use stochastic datasets from one area to mimic the stochastic behavior in another area

### Example:
A bee's flight path has a general directionality (Diagonally upwards). However, it's flight tends to randomly move from left to right and up to down.
A stock's price movement also has the element of general directionality (Diagonally upwards), but randomly moves upwards and downwards. 
By piecing together 3 different stock prices, the combined coordinates of the prices seems to somewhat mimic the upward flight of a bee.
